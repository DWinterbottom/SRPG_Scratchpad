##SRPG_Scratchpad
Godot project to put some code-doodles in.
It's on github because I want to switch machines.
Don't expect much, I'll probably forget about it.

#But...
I kinda fancy trying out coding up some SRPG mechanics.
The idea is to start basic - pretty much just a way to view the map and characters.
Then try add in some AI planning, and ideally test out some gameplay ideas.

If I end up using external assets they'll have their own license text. Here's hoping I remember.
